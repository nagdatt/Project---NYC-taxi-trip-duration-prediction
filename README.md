# Project---NYC-taxi-trip-duration-prediction
To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.  **The aim of this project is to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.**
